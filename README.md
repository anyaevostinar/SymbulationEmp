This is a software model of symbiosis which allows for evolution of parasitism and mutualism. 

Go to [https://anyaevostinar.github.io/SymbulationEmp/web/symbulation.html](https://anyaevostinar.github.io/SymbulationEmp/web/symbulation.html) to try it out in your web browser!

To build, you must first download Empirical (https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical) and place the two repositories on the same level. Then within SymbulationEmp, run 'make' and then './symbulation'. The script 'stats_scripts/simple_repeat.py' can be used to run many replicates and treatments.

The current settings can be configured in SymSettings.cfg. 

To run end-to-end tests run 'make test'. This will overwrite the default SymSettings.cfg!
